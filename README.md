# Price Tracker 
The Price Tracker is a web application that allows users to track the price of products from different online stores. Users can input the URL of the product they are interested in, set a target price, and get notifications when the product price drops below the target. This project was built using Python and Flask and is designed to help users save money by monitoring prices automatically.

## Python Libraries:
1. bs4 (BeautifulSoup4): bs4 (BeautifulSoup4) is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from page source code, which can be used to extract data from web pages in a structured way.

2. smtplib: smtplib is a built-in Python library used to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It can be used to send emails from a script by connecting to an SMTP server (like Gmail, Yahoo, or any custom SMTP server) and transmitting the message.

3. flask: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used for building web applications. It's known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications or as a microservice. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja, and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

## CSV file:
A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a simple text file format used to store tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases. Each row in the CSV file corresponds to a data record, and each field (or value) within that row is separated by a comma (hence the name "comma-separated").

## Exception Handling
In Flask, exception handling is important for managing errors and preventing crashes when unexpected situations arise during the processing of requests. Using try and except blocks in Python, we can catch and handle errors gracefully. Instead of having the application crash with a server error (500), you can customize error responses, log errors, or take specific actions based on different exceptions.
* try
* except 

## Running the App
* run the application with command: python app.py
